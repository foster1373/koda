    bio: `Jake Klausner grew up in Columbus, Ohio, where his early love for music met a lifelong obsession with guitar. Picking up the instrument at 17, he dove headfirst into blues and rock, teaching himself the language of classic players like Jimi Hendrix and John Frusciante. That foundation shaped his expressive, riff-driven lead style that now fuels Koda’s live energy. Outside the band, Jake is a biomedical engineer by day and a relentless creative by night—splitting time between research, songwriting, and refining his tone. `,

    bio: `Jackson Buss discovered his passion for music at a young age, inspired by his father, who owned a chain of record stores in his youth. Surrounded by timeless and modern records growing up, Jackson spent countless hours learning the piano before eventually picking up the guitar.
    
    Throughout school, he jammed with close friends in basements, backyards, and dorm rooms—spaces where the foundation of KODA was first built alongside Brewer and Klausner through a shared love of music. As the band grew, Jackson continued honing his craft, becoming a key contributor on both guitar and piano. His sound is heavily influenced by the grit of southern rock and the soul of the blues, bringing energy and emotion to every track.
    
    When he’s not on stage or in the studio, you’ll likely find him behind the wheel of the “KODA Bus,” keeping the band rolling down the road. Off the road, Jackson enjoys collecting vinyl records and spending time with his family on their cattle farm.`,

    name: 'Jake Brewer',
    role: 'Bass Guitar',

    bio: `Jake Brewer’s journey into music began with a pair of headphones and his late father’s iPod, packed with thousands of songs from legends like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath. That early exposure lit a spark that’s never gone out. He started jamming with Klausner and Buss back in high school, forming the original trio that would evolve into the band you hear today.

    Though he first picked up the guitar, Jake found his true musical voice in the bass, falling in love with its rhythm, groove, and soul. His playing brings depth and drive to the band’s sound, blending classic inspiration with a modern edge.

    Offstage, Jake leads a double life as an insurance agent—but his heart’s never far from the stage. When he’s not laying down basslines, you’ll find him hiking the outdoors with music in his ears.`,

    bio: `Brian’s been behind a drum kit since first grade. By high school he was president of the marching band and section leader of the jazz band—early chops paired with a lifelong love of rock now power every driving beat he lays down with KODA.

A Cleveland native, Brian will graduate in May 2025 from The Ohio State University with a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering and a Mathematics minor—specializing in AI and full‑stack development.

When he’s not lifting or chasing the next outdoor adrenaline rush, he’s probably jamming out to whatever album he’s got on repeat. With the same focus he brings to the drum kit, Brian built this entire site from the ground up using React, Chakra UI, and modern web tools to spotlight KODA’s story.`,

    bio: `Jake has been singing and playing music for as long as he can remember. He grew up singing in church as a child and joined his first choir in the 5th grade. He started taking piano lessons in 4th grade and sang in several other auditioned choirs throughout middle school. 
    
    In high school he joined Parkway West High’s esteemed Jazz choir along with vocalist Nolan Barbre where they learned under Brian Parrish, who they both hold in extremely high regard for his teaching and playing abilities. In college, Jake joined Miami University’s premier mens a capella group, Soul2Soul. While in college, Juenger met Buss, Klausner and Brewer at a halloween party his freshman year. Several months later, him and Buss, then a Miami student, reconnected and began jamming together in dorm rooms before Buss invited him to join the group.
    
    While still in school, Juenger would drive from Oxford to Columbus to play shows on the weekends before eventually moving back home to St Louis, where he continued to put miles on his car driving 6 hours instead of 2 for gigs. Juenger finally decided to move to Columbus to be closer to the group and is slowly settling into calling Ohio his new home. `,

    bio: `For Nolan, music started with lullabies and Beatle’s music in the crib. After singing in church as child, he joined choir in 5th grade with co-lead Jake Juenger. It wasn’t until he found a Snoop Dogg CD in his father’s car that discovered that music could be audacious, mysterious, and most importantly, fun. Moving forward discovering numerous musical influences from all points in time, he finds the most inspiration from acts like Queen, James Brown, Prince, Elton John, Kendrick Lamar, and Michael Jackson.

    After going to school at Missouri State for music education and theory studies, Nolan chose to leave school and work full time. You can catch him at Valvoline during the day, but outside of work he continues to immerse himself in new music, constantly learning and figuring out how to make the next performance and explosion of emotion.`,
